```javascript
// Ensure correct order of classes. Put the hover class after the base class.
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4 hover:bg-blue-700">
  Hover me!
</div>

// Or use important to override other CSS rules
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4 hover:bg-blue-700 !important">
  Hover me!
</div>

//Alternative Solution
//If the problem persists, check for conflicting CSS rules by inspecting the element in the browser's developer tools.
//Try adding !important flag if specificity issues are present.
