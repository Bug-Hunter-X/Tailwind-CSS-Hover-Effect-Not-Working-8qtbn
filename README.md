# Tailwind CSS Hover Effect Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: hover effects not working as expected.  The problem occurs because of an incorrect order of classes or unintended CSS specificity overriding the hover state. The provided solution explains this issue and offers the best approach to resolving this type of problem. 

## Problem
The `hover:bg-blue-700` class does not correctly change the background color on hover. This is because of how Tailwind CSS handles class precedence. The hover class is considered less specific than other classes.
